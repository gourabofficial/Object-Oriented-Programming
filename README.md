## Introduction

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

In this repository, you will find examples demonstrating the key principles of OOP in Java, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
